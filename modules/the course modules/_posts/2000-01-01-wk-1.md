## Week one: The role of the facilitator

Welcome to week one!

Go through the following sections at your own pace to complete this first module. 

In this module, we will discuss what it means to be a facilitator, drawing on learning from a recent trial using the Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis ([T-SEDA](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/)). This will include the role of the facilitator, possible facilitation models, and issues and potential constraints faced by facilitators. Your objective this week is to (roughly) identify your aims for your facilitation.

*Familiarise yourself with the following available resources (these will help you throughout this course and beyond!):*

It's not necessary for you to review these in-depth at this time, but it will be helpful to familiarise yourself with the following resources to draw on during your facilitation planning over the next 6 modules.

* [T-SEDA](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/): This resource pack that has been drawn on for the basis of this course. If you are not already familiar with it, now is the time!
* [CEDiR site](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/cedir/): This website includes a summary of current projects by CEDiR colleagues, which offer their own resources and relevant content.
* [Edudialogue.org](https://www.edudialogue.org/): This site is where the discussion forum is hosted but it also includes a range of helpful resources for you to look through.

## Do

Please review and complete the following activities for this week:

* Please fill out the [registration and consent form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVGqzG-GIDHSu8U08oDWFrMHdD8bd1ignlVQ5tUBtrw8dpPw/viewform?usp=sf_link) for the use of your data.
* Review the [MOOC user guide](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/introduction/MOOC-user-guide/) and the [course etiquette](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/introduction/course-etiquette/) if you have not done so already.
* Listen to the following audio recording from a facilitator interview. This recording is the first of a series of interviews with facilitators where they share successes, challenges and tips for those considering facilitation.

* Draft an initial skeleton of your facilitation plan to add ideas to over the next few weeks. You can use the sample one listed in the resource section above titled ‘Facilitation plan template’ for inspiration, but remember that yours should reflect the unique context of your setting so please adapt as you see fit or start one from scratch.
* Using ‘Facilitator Resource 1’ available above and the initial guiding questions in Step 1, begin to think through your aims for your facilitation. Answer the following questions, writing your answers in your facilitation plan template or in your own version:
  * What have I noticed as a problem or point of interest in my setting regarding educational dialogue?
  * What do I hope to achieve through this facilitation?
  * What are my personal and professional motivations for facilitation?

## Discuss

*If you have not yet already registered on the discussion forum, you will need to do this first [here](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/facilitation-selfpaced/). Take a look at the [MOOC user guide](https://mbrugha.github.io/facilitation/modules/introduction/MOOC-user-guide/) for more instructions on how to do this.*

*If you have not already written an introduction in the [introduction channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/facilitation-selfpaced/introductions-4/#post-306) on the forum, please do this first. Instructions are included at the top of the channel.*

This week, in the [week one channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/facilitation-selfpaced/week-one-the-role-of-the-facilitator-4/) on the forum, write a post to address the following questions:

1. Who are you? Where are you? Describe your setting for your facilitation.
2. What’s your motivation or driving force behind your facilitation?
3. Think through the challenges – what do you think will be the most challenging aspect of facilitation in your setting?

Remember to respond to others' posts too! Even if you're taking the course as a self-paced series, you might find that you're taking it the same time as someone else.
