## Week one: The role of the facilitator



Welcome to week one!

Go through the following sections at your own pace to complete this first module. 

In this module, we will discuss what it means to be a facilitator, drawing on learning from a recent trial using the Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis ([T-SEDA](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/)). This will include the role of the facilitator, possible facilitation models, and issues and potential constraints faced by facilitators. Your objective this week is to (roughly) identify your aims for your facilitation.

* [T-SEDA](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/): This resource pack that has been drawn on for the basis of this course. If you are not already familiar with it, now is the time!

* [Edudialogue.org](https://www.edudialogue.org/): This site is where the discussion forum is hosted but it also includes a range of helpful resources for you to look through.



## Do

Please review and complete the following activities for this week:

* Please fill out the [registration and consent form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVGqzG-GIDHSu8U08oDWFrMHdD8bd1ignlVQ5tUBtrw8dpPw/viewform?usp=sf_link) for the use of your data.
* Review the [MOOC user guide](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/introduction/MOOC-user-guide/) and the [course etiquette](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/introduction/course-etiquette/) if you have not done so already.

* Draft an initial skeleton of your facilitation plan to add ideas to over the next few weeks. You can use the sample one listed in the resource section above titled ‘Facilitation plan template’ for inspiration, but remember that yours should reflect the unique context of your setting so please adapt as you see fit or start one from scratch.
* Using ‘Facilitator Resource 1’ available above and the initial guiding questions in Step 1, begin to think through your aims for your facilitation. Answer the following questions, writing your answers in your facilitation plan template or in your own version:
  * What have I noticed as a problem or point of interest in my setting regarding educational dialogue?
  * What do I hope to achieve through this facilitation?
  * What are my personal and professional motivations for facilitation?
